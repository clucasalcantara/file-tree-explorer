# React File Tree

This repository contains a version of a file tree explorer

We are going for a next js application just to display a good boilerplate written with market rules, standards and metrics.

We also follow a modular approach based on the src file, which each folder contains what its own name represents

## To Run

```bash
$ npm i
```

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

## Improvements

- Solve some selection glitches
- Finalize action menu
- Add unitary tests
